                The KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Swedish: Kungliga Tekniska högskolan, lit. 'Royal Technical High
                School'), abbreviated KTH, is a public research university in Stockholm, Sweden. KTH conducts research
                and education in engineering and technology and is Sweden's largest technical university.[3]
                Currently,[when?] KTH consists of five schools with four campuses in and around Stockholm.

                KTH was established in 1827 as the Teknologiska institutet (Institute of Technology) and had its roots
                in the Mekaniska skolan (School of Mechanics) that was established in 1798 in Stockholm. But the origin
                of KTH dates back to the predecessor of the Mekaniska skolan, the Laboratorium mechanicum, which was
                established in 1697 by the Swedish scientist and innovator Christopher Polhem. The Laboratorium
                mechanicum combined education technology, a laboratory, and an exhibition space for innovations.[4] In
                1877, KTH received its current name, Kungliga Tekniska högskolan (KTH Royal Institute of Technology).
                The Swedish king, Carl XVI Gustaf, is the patron of KTH.

                KTH is ranked 73rd in the world among all universities in the 2024 QS World University Rankings, which
                is higher than any other university in the Nordic countries.[5]

                History
                KTH's earliest Swedish predecessor was the Laboratorium Mechanicum, a collection of mechanical models
                for teaching created in 1697 by Christopher Polhem. Polhem is considered to be the father of mechanics
                in Sweden. He founded the laboratorium as a school and research facility in the engineering field of
                mechanics after his extensive trips, studies and research abroad.[6] The mechanical models that formed
                the basis of the education were used intermittently for teaching practical mechanics by different
                masters until the School of Mechanics (Mekaniska skolan) was founded in 1798. In 1827 the School of
                Mechanics was transformed into the Technological Institute (Teknologiska institutet), following the
                establishment of polytechnical schools in many European countries the early years of the 19th century,
                often based on the model of École polytechnique in Paris.</p>
